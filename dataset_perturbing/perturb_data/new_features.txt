TODO: add tags to items which have very few tags (would this be a large perturbation though?) -> this would be a small perturbation because the size of a perturbation is determined by the number of tags added, not the change it results in
TODO: delete from items which are described by a large number of tags
TODO: add tags to items which have many tags (small perturbation)
TODO: delete the least common tag from all items it describes
TODO: add method that identifies the minimum number of tags required to change a description and adds them
