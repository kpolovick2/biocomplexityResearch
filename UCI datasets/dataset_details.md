# The Iris Dataset
This dataset contains data about irises from Fisher, 1936. There are 5 attributes, which are as follows:
- sepal length (in cm)
- sepal width (in cm)
- petal length (in cm)
- petal width (in cm)
- class of iris

There are three classes of iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. 
Aside from the class data, which is categorical, the rest of the data is discrete, measured
to the nearest tenth. The class attribute should ideally be used as the cluster for each data item.
There are 150 data items, with 50 data items in each cluster.

# The Mushroom Dataset
This dataset contains 23 attributes, listed in the following order:
1. poisonous or edible
2. cap shape
3. cap surface
4. cap color 
5. bruises 
6. odor
7. gill attachment
8. gill spacing
9. gill size
10. gill color
11. stalk shape
12. stalk root
13. stalk surface above the ring
14. stalk surface below the ring
15. stalk color above the ring 
16. stalk color below the ring
17. veil type
18. veil color
19. ring number
20. ring type
21. spore print color
22. population
23. habitat

The first attribute can and should be used as cluster information, meaning there are two clusters.
Attributes 14-17 for this dataset are identical for all data items, so should ideally be excluded from the dataset in an experimental setting.
There are 8124 data items in this dataset.

# The Wine Dataset

There are 13 attributes in this dataset, which are as follows:
1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid 
3. Ash 
4. Alcalinity of ash
5. Magnesium 
6. Total phenols 
7. Flavanoids 
8. Nonflavanoid phenols 
9. Proanthocyanins 
10. Color intensity 
11. Hue 
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
13. Proline 

There first attribute, alcohol has three types.
These correspond to the three clusters of the dataset.
This dataset has 178 data items, in clusters of 59, 72, and 47.
None of the attributes describe an overwhelming number of items within each cluster.
